# Proj

`proj` is a CLI application that helps you manage your coding projects. Do you often face the problem of different
projects using different development environments and commands to start? That's where `proj` comes in.

With `proj`, you can add your projects and manage them through a central CLI.

## Features

- **Add Projects**: Add new projects with a name and description.
- **Delete Projects**: Remove projects from your management.
- **Execute Projects**: Start projects through the CLI.
- **Label Management**: Add or remove labels to/from projects.
- **List Projects**: Display all managed projects.
- **Show Project Details**: Display details of a specific project.
- **Update Projects**: Update project details such as path, execution command, or description.
